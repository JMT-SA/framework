== Behaviours

Behaviours are used to bring dynamic changes to forms in the UI.
e.g. To limit the options of one dropdown based on the current selection of another.

The following behaviours can be specified for a field renderer:

* <<Enable>>

=== Add a behaviour

In a UiRule, behaviours are added like this:
```.ruby
behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.enable :other, when: :applet, changes_to: ['other']
end
```

=== Enable

Description:

This behaviour attaches to a source field and enables/disables a target field based on the value of the source field.

Format:

`enable(target_field, conditions = {})`

`target_field` is the name of the field to be enabled/disabled.

Conditions:

* `when:` Symbol
+
The source field to observe.
* `changes_to:` Array
+

Example:
```.ruby
behaviours do |behaviour|
  behaviour.enable :more_info, when: :refferred_by, changes_to: ['unknown', 'other']
end
```
